## Usage
Each design in this repository is organized into two distinct folders to ensure ease of navigation and clarity:

- **SCAD Folder**: 
  - Contains all the OpenSCAD source files. 
  - These are the raw, editable files that you can use to modify and understand the design process.

- **STL Folder**: 
  - Here, you'll find the STL files of the designs. 
  - These are ready for 3D printing or viewing in 3D modeling software. 
  - They represent the final output of the design.
